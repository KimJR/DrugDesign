## Content
The script is a Python script written for the PyMOL program. The script expects 2 files of the type mol2, a halogen and a nitrogen as input. In the first step, these two molecules are rotated and aligned around the axes x, y and z by selecting individual atoms. A copy of the halogen is then created and a grid is later created from this copy. The halogen is copied again several times and placed at the grid points.

These grid points can be entered manually or generated randomly. Then the coordinates and points of the halogen copies are saved in a.mol2 file. For the randomized grid generation, a statistical evaluation of the angles of rotation around the axes is also shown in a plot in order to see the distribution

## Input Parameters
Filename1 = "file1.mol2"
Filename2 = "file2.mol2"
pathToSave = "/Results"
fileType  = "mol2"


## Installation

### Linux
Matplotlib is part of the standard Linux repository and can thus be installed via the package manager.
Debian/Ubuntu:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlibFedora/Redhat:sudo yum install python-matplotlib
```

### Windows
For standard Python installations, matplotlib is installed with pip:
 ```sh
$  python -m pip install -U pip setuptoolspython -m pip install matplotlib
```

### MacOSX
In Mac OSX, the matplotlib binaries can be installed using the standard Python installer pip.
See Installing OSX Binary Wheels: https://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html#install-osx-binaries.

### Included packages
- from pymol import cmd
- from pymol import math
- import numpy
- import random
- import  matplotlib
- import  matplotlib . pyplot  as  plt
